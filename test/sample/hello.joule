Zol'kari zin'zal, zol'kari zin'zal, zol'kari zin'zal,
(From the first star's light, to the last star's fall,)

Zir'kari zin'zal, zir'kari zin'zal, zir'kari zin'zal.
(From the first moon's rise, to the last moon's call.)

Zol'kari zin'zal, zol'kari zin'zal, zol'kari zin'zal,
(From the first star's light, to the last star's fall,)

Zir'kari zin'zal, zir'kari zin'zal, zir'kari zin'zal.
(From the first moon's rise, to the last moon's call.)

In the cycle of Zol and Zir, we live our lives, 
(With the rhythm of stars and moons, we thrive.)

Our days are filled with the language of the cosmos, 
(We speak in whispers of stardust and echoes of nebulae.)

We weave the fabric of time with our thoughts,
(Our minds are looms, our ideas, threads of cosmic silk.)

Our nights are illuminated by the knowledge of the universe,
(We dream in constellations and awaken in galaxies.)

This is the daily rhythm of our alien existence,
(A dance of light and shadow, a symphony of celestial resonance.)
